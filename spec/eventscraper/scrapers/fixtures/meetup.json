This FREE 3 day event will blow you away and revolutionise your life.<br \/><br \/>Starting from the very basics of NLP, talking about your conscious and unconscious (or subconscious) mind and the roles that they play in achieving (or not achieving as the case may be!) your life goals.<br \/><br \/>If you aren't sure what your life goals are, you will be asked what your values are and that you should try to align your life goals to your values (or vice versa).<br \/><br \/>But the best part of all is that you will be given tools to harness the power of your unconscious mind so that you can blast forward at lightspeed to achieve your goals.<br \/><br \/>This will be done through some explanations but mainly through the power of self-hypnosis. Chris Howard will show you how to do this but then it will be up to you personally to keep using those tools on yourself.<br \/><br \/>I've gone to Breakthrough to Success twice now, and each time come away with something more - renewed optimism and enthusiasm, and some real-life changes in my life. I've also signed up for some of his paid courses (I'm doing his NLP Results and Masters in November and studying for it now) but you don't have to buy any of the courses he offers if you don't want to.<br \/><br \/>AGENDA<br \/><br \/>12 Feb (Fri) 6pm-10pm<br \/>=====================<br \/>The unconscious mind, Cause and Effect, The Power of Focus, Where are you most stuck and Why, Your life in the future (your goals), Your Life Values<br \/><br \/>13 Feb (Sat) 9am-8pm<br \/>================<br \/>Values (Part 2), Strategic Visioning, Living a Rich Life, Negative Emotions, Emotions Obliterator, Limiting Decisions, Decision Destroyer,<br \/><br \/>14 Feb (Sun) 9am-8pm<br \/>===============<br \/>The Basis of Long Term Change<br \/><br \/><br \/>WARNING<br \/>This free seminar may be the single best thing you've done in my life, but it is very long days and requires a full time committment from you as you can see!

Well, I've read lots of books and I've spoken to quite a few entrepreneurs and the one thing that they all seem to have in common is that they had a vision, a goal, a dream. Call it what you like, they all had an idea or image in their mind that they created as a visual board\/image that kept them focused on their dream. <br \/><br \/>Melina Di Santo is our guest speaker for this special event. Melina will be speaking to us to kick start 2010 and introducing us to tools like Vision Boards to bring our dreams closer to us. This meet up is going to give you some inspiration and motivation for you and your business for the forthcoming year. So whether you have already created your dream business or job or if you are still thinking about your path for 2010, after this meet up hopefully you will get some clarity. <br \/><br \/>I was invited for a program in which Melina was guest speaker and I tell there was so much energy in the room by the time she finished with us we were all so energized and ready to give our lives more meaning.<br \/><br \/>From another Guest:-<br \/><br \/>I created a vision board about 18 months ago with Melina. All I can say is this is a powerful tool to use and it is really life changing. I read an article the other day that reported that all successful entrepreneurs interviewed, had created a vision board in order to keep them on track with their dreams and aspirations to build a successful business.<br \/><br \/>If you have any questions for Melina please email me before the event so that I can pass them on. Don't forget to bring your business cards as there will be the usual networking after Melina's talk.<br \/><br \/>Until then, best wishes.<br \/><br \/>Placida<br \/>","name":"Your Vision Your Success Your Future with Melina Di Santo","group":{"id":1354815,"name":"The Bod - Business Networking Group","urlname":"The-Bod"}},{"id":12460866,"time":1266949800000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/rareworld\/calendar\/12460866\/","description":"BUSINESS IMAGE, BEAUTY AND FITNESS NETWORKING EVENT<br \/>(You can bring a guest\/s to this event.)<br \/><br \/>It is time to make 2010 the new you, no more excuses!<br \/><br \/>During this networking event you will learn essential business image tips from RareWorld Image Consultancy about how to create that great first impression.

This FREE 3 day event will blow you away and revolutionise your life.<br \/><br \/>Starting from the very basics of NLP, talking about your conscious and unconscious (or subconscious) mind and the roles that they play in achieving (or not achieving as the case may be!) your life goals.<br \/><br \/>If you aren't sure what your life goals are, you will be asked what your values are and that you should try to align your life goals to your values (or vice versa).<br \/><br \/>But the best part of all is that you will be given tools to harness the power of your unconscious mind so that you can blast forward at lightspeed to achieve your goals.<br \/><br \/>This will be done through some explanations but mainly through the power of self-hypnosis. Chris Howard will show you how to do this but then it will be up to you personally to keep using those tools on yourself.<br \/><br \/>I've gone to Breakthrough to Success twice now, and each time come away with something more - renewed optimism and enthusiasm, and some real-life changes in my life.

Are you prepared to suspend doubt for just a moment and open your mind to the possibility that you can have anything you want?<br \/><br \/><b>The First Principle You Must Understand To Build Riches<\/b><br \/><br \/>The first step is to recognise the social hypnosis you’ve been living in. Before you can truly be wealthy and happy, you must first open your mind to the fact there is so much more richness and possibility available to you. I am not asking you to believe it yet. Just open the door to the possibility that there is something more.<br \/><br \/>You see, 98% of the people in the world aren’t really going for it in life, and they’re not living rich and fulfilling lives. Why? Because the negative reporting in the media—in their social circles, in newspapers and on TV—is influencing and controlling their psychology!<br \/><br \/>Most people who struggle in life have no clue what the real problem is and what’s holding them back. Even fewer people realise the harmful effect paying attention to—and believing—this negative reporting is having on their mindset.<br \/><br \/>And so, without their even realising it, their minds are literally being controlled in order to limit their thinking about what is possible.<br \/><br \/>During Wealth Propulsion your thinking in relation to your finances will be completely overhauled and you will gain massive propulsion towards the wealth you’ve always deserved. It’s about kicking your financial evolution into high gear. It’s totally focused on your finances, on embracing a new mindset to revolutionise your world financially.<br \/><br \/>The course is based on an expert team studying 300 of the world’s super-wealthy, super-successful, super-fulfilled people. People like Richard Branson, Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett, Li Ka Shing (Hong Kong’s richest man) and more.<br \/><br \/>The course also borrows from such business visionaries as Walt Disney, Jack Welch, Steve Case of AOL, and from Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, who are now giving back 1% of everything they make through Google.org.<br \/><br \/>If you truly want to be rich, happy, and successful, I recommend you replicate the strategies of wealthy and successful people and stop modelling mediocrity. Imagine what you could accomplish and experience in your life if you truly had a millionaire mindset.<br \/><br \/>... If you want to always prosper financially—no matter what is happening around you—then develop your latent talents and potential money-making ideas.<br \/><br \/>... If you want to be truly indispensable in any career you pursue, seek out specialised education. This is especially important while the market is changing so fast.<br \/><br \/>... If you want to live a life of fulfilment and passion, take those old dreams out of the closet and find the people who can help you make them a reality.<br \/><br \/><br \/>SCHEDULE<br \/><br \/>16 Apr (Fri) 6pm-10pm<br \/>=====================<br \/>The unconscious mind, Cause and Effect, The Power of Focus, Where are you most stuck and Why, Your life in the future (your goals), Your Life Values<br \/>17 Apr (Sat) 9am-9pm<br \/>================<br \/>Values (Part 2), Strategic Visioning, Living a Rich Life, Negative Emotions, Emotions Obliterator, Limiting Decisions, Decision Destroyer,<br \/><br \/>18 Apr (Sun) 9am-8pm<br \/>===============<br \/>The Basis of Long Term Change<br \/><br \/><br \/>WARNING<br \/>This low cost seminar may be the single best thing you've done in your life, but it is very long days and requires a full time committment from you as you can see! <br \/><br \/>To get your free tickets to this event, you can click on this link or the image below:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/?af=CLS1034584\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/?af=CLS1034584\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.wealthprop...<\/a><\/a><br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/?af=CLS1034584\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/templates\/edwardhadome_landingpage_template\/images\/newheader.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt='' \/><\/a><br \/><br \/>Cheers all!<br \/><br \/>Esther<br \/>","name":"Wealth Propulsion 3 Day Seminar - FREE","group":{"id":1457989,"name":"Chris Howard Success and NLP Network Group","urlname":"Chris-Howard-Success-NLP-Network"},"venue":{"id":1090870,"phone":"0871 984 1955","lon":-0.190727,"name":"    Chelsea Football Club","address_1":"Stamford Bridge ","address_2":"Fulham Road","lat":51.481766,"city":"London","country":"gb"}},{"id":12741748,"time":1268127000000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chris-Howard-Success-NLP-Network\/calendar\/12741748\/","description":"Are You a Trainer, Coach or HR Specialist…<br \/><br \/>…..interested in expanding your portfolio of solutions?<br \/><br \/>If the answer to that question is ‘YES’, I would like to invite you to a DISC ‘taster’ session which is all about DiSC® and our DiSC® certification training<br \/><br \/>''Thanks very much for a great taster session with a very warm welcome.

This FREE 3 day event will blow you away and revolutionise your life.<br \/><br \/>Starting from the very basics of NLP, talking about your conscious and unconscious (or subconscious) mind and the roles that they play in achieving (or not achieving as the case may be!) your life goals.<br \/><br \/>If you aren't sure what your life goals are, you will be asked what your values are and that you should try to align your life goals to your values (or vice versa).<br \/><br \/>But the best part of all is that you will be given tools to harness the power of your unconscious mind so that you can blast forward at lightspeed to achieve your goals.<br \/><br \/>This will be done through some explanations but mainly through the power of self-hypnosis. Chris Howard will show you how to do this but then it will be up to you personally to keep using those tools on yourself.<br \/><br \/>I've gone to Breakthrough to Success twice now, and each time come away with something more - renewed optimism and enthusiasm, and some real-life changes in my life.

She lived in China until she was 14. During the Japanese occupation in the 1930s, forced by events to leave China, she reached Italy on a Greek ship.<br \/><br \/>Abandoned by her parents, she was placed in a Catholic orphanage, where she remained until she was 19. Bamboo then became a model and worked in the Italian fashion world in Milan. After marrying an Englishman, they came to live in London, where Bamboo now lives and writes much of the time.<br \/><br \/>Bamboo has written a number of books in Italian about her life and experiences, but a recent one, Blue China, has been translated into English and published in London.<br \/><br \/><br \/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br \/>Bamboo Hirst will be speaking about her own experiences in life, set against the background of her native China, particularly Shanghai during the years of Japanese encroachment and occupation. In the ‘swinging 30s’ it was a cosmopolitan city, with its Foreign Concessions, and opulent social life of the rich, frenzied business activities, political conspiracies and the desperate poverty and living squalor of the Chinese under-class, the rickshaw-pullers and beggars adrift in the city.<br \/><br \/>Bamboo will describe and reflect on the world she left behind and later visited many decades later, and how she found China had been transformed beyond recognition.

Are you prepared to suspend doubt for just a moment and open your mind to the possibility that you can have anything you want?<br \/><br \/><b>The First Principle You Must Understand To Build Riches<\/b><br \/><br \/>The first step is to recognise the social hypnosis you’ve been living in. Before you can truly be wealthy and happy, you must first open your mind to the fact there is so much more richness and possibility available to you. I am not asking you to believe it yet. Just open the door to the possibility that there is something more.<br \/><br \/>You see, 98% of the people in the world aren’t really going for it in life, and they’re not living rich and fulfilling lives. Why? Because the negative reporting in the media—in their social circles, in newspapers and on TV—is influencing and controlling their psychology!<br \/><br \/>Most people who struggle in life have no clue what the real problem is and what’s holding them back. Even fewer people realise the harmful effect paying attention to—and believing—this negative reporting is having on their mindset.<br \/><br \/>And so, without their even realising it, their minds are literally being controlled in order to limit their thinking about what is possible.<br \/><br \/>During Wealth Propulsion your thinking in relation to your finances will be completely overhauled and you will gain massive propulsion towards the wealth you’ve always deserved. It’s about kicking your financial evolution into high gear. It’s totally focused on your finances, on embracing a new mindset to revolutionise your world financially.<br \/><br \/>The course is based on an expert team studying 300 of the world’s super-wealthy, super-successful, super-fulfilled people. People like Richard Branson, Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett, Li Ka Shing (Hong Kong’s richest man) and more.<br \/><br \/>The course also borrows from such business visionaries as Walt Disney, Jack Welch, Steve Case of AOL, and from Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, who are now giving back 1% of everything they make through Google.org.<br \/><br \/>If you truly want to be rich, happy, and successful, I recommend you replicate the strategies of wealthy and successful people and stop modelling mediocrity. Imagine what you could accomplish and experience in your life if you truly had a millionaire mindset.<br \/><br \/>... If you want to always prosper financially—no matter what is happening around you—then develop your latent talents and potential money-making ideas.<br \/><br \/>... If you want to be truly indispensable in any career you pursue, seek out specialised education. This is especially important while the market is changing so fast.<br \/><br \/>... If you want to live a life of fulfilment and passion, take those old dreams out of the closet and find the people who can help you make them a reality.<br \/><br \/><br \/>SCHEDULE<br \/><br \/>16 Apr (Fri) 6pm-10pm<br \/>=====================<br \/>The unconscious mind, Cause and Effect, The Power of Focus, Where are you most stuck and Why, Your life in the future (your goals), Your Life Values<br \/><br \/>17 Apr (Sat) 9am-9pm<br \/>================<br \/>Values (Part 2), Strategic Visioning, Living a Rich Life, Negative Emotions, Emotions Obliterator, Limiting Decisions, Decision Destroyer,<br \/><br \/>18 Apr (Sun) 9am-8pm<br \/>===============<br \/>The Basis of Long Term Change<br \/><br \/><br \/>WARNING<br \/>This low cost seminar may be the single best thing you've done in your life, but it is very long days and requires a full time committment from you as you can see! <br \/><br \/>To get your free tickets to this event, you can click on this link or the image below:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/?af=CLS1034584\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/?af=CLS1034584\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.wealthprop...<\/a><\/a><br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/?af=CLS1034584\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.wealthpropulsion.co.uk\/templates\/edwardhadome_landingpage_template\/images\/newheader.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt='' \/><\/a><br \/><br \/>Cheers all!<br \/><br \/>Esther<br \/>","name":"Wealth Propulsion 3 Day Seminar - FREE","group":{"id":1587911,"name":"Entrepreneurs Would Like to Meet...","urlname":"Entrepreneurs-Would-Like-to-Meet"},"venue":{"id":1090870,"phone":"0871 984 1955","lon":-0.190727,"name":"    Chelsea Football Club","address_1":"Stamford Bridge ","address_2":"Fulham Road","lat":51.481766,"city":"London","country":"gb"}},{"id":12980323,"time":1271351700000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chris-Howard-Success-NLP-Network\/calendar\/12980323\/","description":"Dear all, <br \/><br \/>Do you have limiting beliefs and decisions that hold you back from achieving all that you wish to achieve in life?<br \/><br \/>These sessions are mixed sessions for people who are interested in using NLP for moving forward and also for NLP practitioners to train their skills on others and maybe get a few clients!<br \/><br \/>DECISION DESTROYER<br \/>During the course of our lives, we make decisions about who we are or what we can do that limits us from achieving our full potential.<br \/><br \/>Using this technique from Chris Howard's Breakthrough to Success, we will be destroying that decision and releasing it as well as implementing new beliefs that will empower us to greater success!<br \/><br \/><br \/>FORMAT OF THE EVENING<br \/>6.15pm - Arrivals<br \/>6.30pm Introductions<br \/>6.45pm Decision Destroyer<br \/>7.00pm Practise in pairs<br \/>7.40pm Feedback, Q&amp;A<br \/>8-8.30pm To the pub!<br \/><br \/>Because of space limitations, I will be limiting the numbers to 12, so please RSVP and book your place quickly!<br \/><br \/>LOCATION<br \/>Meeting room at Studio 2.

I'm super thrilled to be able to offer you the first taster of the NLP Communication Training Sessions.<br \/><br \/>The basic premise of Black Belt Communicators is for people to train in communication skills in the same way as they would train in a Martial Art such as Aikido or Karate.<br \/><br \/>Just like Karate, Communication is a skill that can only be taught through repetitive training, practising again and again and again until it becomes ingrained into the DNA of the individual.<br \/><br \/>This is why most presentation skills courses, NLP communication courses are ineffective, because they only teach the principles but don’t provide people the opportunity to practise. <br \/><br \/><b>NLP Communication<\/b><br \/><br \/>Some of the techniques we will be practising in NLP communication will be: reading body language, conversational hypnosis, identifying and using VAK preference systems, building rapport, persuading influencing and leading others using their value systems.<br \/><br \/><b>How Black Belt Communicators Works<\/b><br \/><br \/>Just like karate, we offer a coloured belt system to show how advanced a student is in communication.<br \/><br \/>The coloured belt system is:<br \/>white, yellow, green, brown, and black<br \/>All students start out with a white belt and after successfully completing all the content and demonstrating understanding and application they are then subject to a grading test.<br \/><br \/>If they pass the grading, they will then be allowed to progress to the next level.<br \/><br \/><b>Format of training<\/b><br \/><br \/>Every week, apart from Grading weeks, the 2 hour sessions will have the following format:<br \/><br \/>Start – 15 mins\tWelcome\/Greetings by Sensei<br \/>15mins\tOpening affirmations to reflect the Principles of Black Belt Communicators, along with actions to represent the affirmations<br \/><br \/>Exercise to practice building rapport<br \/><br \/>1 hour\tSplit to groups to practice:<br \/><br \/>-\tLevel 1 group will be taught one or two principle each week. After the principle is taught there will be group discussion, and each person has to describe one or more situations in their lives where they have already or can apply the principle. When the teacher feels that a student has fully embraced all the principles in his\/her daily life, they are allowed to progress via grading.<br \/><br \/>-\tLevel 2 group will be taught one principle each week and then given around 3-5 exercises to practice them.<br \/><br \/>-\tLevel 2 group will be taught one principle each week and then have to deliver a 3-5 minute presentation.<br \/> <br \/>30mins\tThe Final Game<br \/><br \/>Each week there will be a different game\/challenge (as yet to be designed) where the students can compete or ‘spar’ to be the champion of the week as voted by the judges or fellow students<br \/><br \/>Grading<br \/><br \/>Every 4-6 months, we will conduct grading exercises in order to allow people to progress to the next level.<br \/><br \/><br \/>FORMAT OF THE EVENING <br \/>    6.15pm - Arrivals<br \/>    6.30pm Introductions<br \/>    6.45pm Communication Principles<br \/>    7.30pm Train, Train, Train<br \/>    8 - 8.30pm <br \/><br \/>There are already 5-6 regulars who come every week, I will be limiting the numbers to 18 overall, so spaces are limited!<br \/><br \/>Date: 7th April 2010 (Wednesday)<br \/>Time: 6:15pm<br \/><br \/>LOCATION:<br \/>Nearest tubes are Angel or Highbury and Islington.

Filmed over a period of several months by an army film crew, this documentary was aired last year on BBC World to great acclaim.<br \/><br \/>Peng Wenlan, Chair of The Meridian Society, will be introducing the film.<br \/> <br \/>A suggested donation of £5 per person for the Sichuan Earthquake Appeal will be collected for the film and proceeds will be forwarded to the British Red Cross.<br \/><br \/>The screening of the documentary is preceded by a talk on “The Art of the Abacus” by Dr Zhang Qing.<br \/> The talk will include a brief history of the origins of the abacus, how it is used and how it compares with the calculator\/computer in recent times.<br \/> Dr Zhang Qing is a businesswoman with a doctorate in Economics. Her experience with the abacus spans more than 20 years, during which time she has worked for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Beijing.
